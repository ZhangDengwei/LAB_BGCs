# LAB BGCs

Lacid bacteria (LAB) produce variousbioactive secondary metabolites (SMs), which endow LAB with a protective role for the host. Here, we systematically investigate the biosynthetic potential of LAB from 31,977 LAB genomes, identifying 130,051 BGCs of 2,849 gene cluster families (GCFs).
